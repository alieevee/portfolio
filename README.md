# Portfolio Project

The box model refers to how HTML elements are modeled in browser engines. HTML elements can be visualised as being capsuled in boxes - every element is a rectangular box - and the dimensions derived from CSS properties. 
There are five main parts to a box: 
1. Content
2. Padding
3. Border
4. Margin
5. Height/Width

The purpose of the box model is for ease of layout design. When a webpage has many elements, have structured boxes to define is more convenient than modifying elements that each have different layout properties. The box model generalises layout properties such that it is compatible across various browser engines.
